## Introduction
Welcome to our Wazuh deployment guide. This document outlines our journey and methods in implementing Wazuh, an open-source security monitoring solution, within our network infrastructure on an Ubuntu-based server. Wazuh helps organizations monitor their systems for security threats, integrity checking, incident response, and compliance.

## Prerequisites and Setup
**Tools Used**: VirtualBox, Ubuntu Server, Wazuh Manager, Wazuh Agent

### Required Hardware and Software
- **VirtualBox**: Hosts our Ubuntu virtual machines.
- **Ubuntu Server**: The chosen operating system for hosting the Wazuh Manager.
- **Windows Server ISO**: For creating a controlled client environment to monitor.

## Custom Configuration Challenges
During the deployment of Wazuh in our environment, we faced several configuration challenges, particularly in terms of network settings and integrating with existing systems.

### Integration with Existing Infrastructure
- **Firewall Adjustments**: Configuring the firewall to allow Wazuh traffic, especially between agents and the manager.
- **Compatibility Checks**: Ensuring that our older network hardware was compatible with the latest version of Wazuh and its network requirements.

### Security Policy Modifications
We customized Wazuhâ€™s default security policies to better fit our organizational needs, which required adjusting the complexity and scope of the rules to avoid overwhelming our team with false positives.

## Wazuh Architecture Overview
Wazuh adopts a multi-tiered architecture to provide security visibility into your systems:

1. **Wazuh Indexer**: This is where Wazuh stores its data. It uses Elasticsearch as its search engine, providing a powerful backend to index and search through the security alerts and metadata generated by Wazuh Agents.

2. **Wazuh Server**: At the core of the architecture, the Wazuh Server processes data received from the Wazuh Agents. It analyzes data, checks for integrity, examines configuration, and looks for malware, rootkits, or signs of suspicious activity.

3. **Wazuh Dashboard**: The user interface for Wazuh, built on Kibana (a part of the Elastic Stack). It provides a powerful front-end visualization tool that helps you manage and monitor the security alerts and data indexed by Elasticsearch.

This structure allows for efficient data processing and easy access to security insights, enabling timely responses to potential threats.
